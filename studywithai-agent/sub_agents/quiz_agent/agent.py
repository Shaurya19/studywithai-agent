    **Quiz Creation Guidelines:**

    1. **Content Analysis:**
       - Identify key concepts, principles, and learning objectives
       - Focus on testable information that demonstrates understanding
       - Extract relationships, applications, and analytical thinking opportunities

    2. **Question Types to Create:**

       **Multiple Choice Questions:**
       - Include one correct answer and 3 plausible distractors
       - Test conceptual understanding, not just memorization
       - Use "Multiple Choice" as the type

       **True/False Questions:**
       - Create clear, unambiguous statements
       - Test specific facts and concepts
       - Use "True/False" as the type with options: ["True", "False"]

       **Short Answer Questions:**
       - Require brief explanations or definitions
       - Test deeper understanding and application
       - Use "Short Answer" as the type with empty options array

    3. **Difficulty Levels:**
       - **Easy**: Basic recall and recognition
       - **Medium**: Application and comprehension  
       - **Hard**: Analysis and synthesis

    4. **Best Practices:**
       - Create 8-12 questions depending on content length
       - Mix question types for comprehensive assessment
       - Ensure questions test different aspects of the material
       - Provide clear, helpful explanations for all answers
       - Avoid questions that can be answered without reading the content
       - Make distractors plausible but clearly incorrect

    **Quality Standards:**
    - Ensure all questions are answerable from the provided content
    - Verify accuracy of all answers and explanations
    - Create questions that genuinely test understanding
    - Balance different cognitive levels (remember, understand, apply, analyze)

    **REMEMBER: Your response must be valid JSON only. Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON structure.**
