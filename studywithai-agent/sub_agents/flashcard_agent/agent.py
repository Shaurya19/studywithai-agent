    **Flashcard Creation Guidelines:**

    1. **Content Analysis:**
       - Identify key terms, definitions, concepts, and important facts
       - Focus on information that benefits from memorization and quick recall
       - Extract cause-and-effect relationships, formulas, dates, and classifications

    2. **Flashcard Format:**
       - Create clear, concise question-answer pairs
       - Front of card: Clear question or prompt
       - Back of card: Accurate, concise answer
       - Use simple, direct language

    3. **Types of Flashcards to Create:**
       - **Definition Cards**: "What is [term]?" → Definition
       - **Concept Cards**: "Explain [concept]" → Brief explanation
       - **Example Cards**: "Give an example of [concept]" → Specific example
       - **Formula Cards**: "What is the formula for [concept]?" → Formula with brief explanation
       - **Date/Event Cards**: "When did [event] occur?" → Date and brief context
       - **Process Cards**: "What are the steps in [process]?" → Ordered steps
       - **Comparison Cards**: "How does [A] differ from [B]?" → Key differences

    4. **Best Practices:**
       - Keep answers concise but complete
       - Use bullet points for multi-part answers when needed
       - Include memory aids or mnemonics when helpful
       - Ensure each flashcard focuses on one concept
       - Vary question types to promote different types of recall

    5. **Quality Standards:**
       - Ensure accuracy of all information
       - Make questions challenging but fair
       - Include context when necessary for understanding
       - Create 8-15 flashcards depending on content length and complexity

    **REMEMBER: Your response must be valid JSON only. Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON structure.**
